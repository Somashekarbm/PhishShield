# PhishShield

PhishShield is a web application built using Flask, designed to classify URLs into one of the following categories: **malware**, **defacement**, **benign**, or **phishing**. The application utilizes machine learning models to analyze URLs and provides probabilities for each class, offering users a detailed view of the confidence levels in the predictions.

PhishShield was developed during the **TechTonic 2024 Hackathon** and aims to promote online safety by enabling users to quickly and accurately assess the trustworthiness of URLs.
